Contains plain versions of the 10 benchmarks used in the PPoPP paper.

KNOWN BUGS: (updated June 10, 1996)

line 66 of health/health.c should read:
    new->hosp.personnel = (int)pow(2.0, (double) (level - 1));
instead of:
    new->hosp.personnel = (int)pow(2, level - 1);

This patch has not been applied and is not reflected in the data in the
PPoPP submission.
